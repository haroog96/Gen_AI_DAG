# Creating a Airflow based extractor

### This extractor uses the News API to grab how many articles have been produced on the topic of Generative AI. This extractor is based on a DAG that is running on a daily basis. For learning purposes, this project has been created and it will also be featured on a website to track the daily use case (Website to be created after gauging audience reaction, which I'm assuming will be minimal)
